Given the endpoint - GET https://bananabudget.azurewebsites.net/?
startDate=10-12-2017&numberOfDays=20
The endpoint will:
Receive requests containing the following inputs: startDate(in the format of MM/DD/
YYYY) and numberOfDays (min: 1, max: 365)
Respond with the following outputs: totalCost
The endpoint determines the output by solving this "Bob's Banana Budget" problem:
Every day, Bob buys a banana from the same grocery store on his way to work. At this
grocery store, bananas are priced in a dynamic, yet predictable way: the first 7 days of
the month, bananas cost $0.05; the second 7 days of the month, bananas cost $0.10;
the third 7 days of the month, bananas cost $0.15; the fourth 7 days of the month,
bananas cost $0.20; and any remaining days of the month after that, bananas cost
$0.25.
Bob wants a tool built that will allow him to budget properly for any span of time.
All he should need to do is provide the date for the calculation to begin and how many
days to calculate (including the beginning date), and the tool should tell him how much
he'll spend during that time.
NOTE: Bob only buys bananas on his work days. You can assume he works a typical
Monday -Friday work week.
Please write a small test suite to test all possible scenarios you can think of for this
endpoint.
The tests should be able to verify results for any given inputs [startDate and
numberOfDays].
Please take no longer than 2 days to complete.
